# cs-250
An SNHU course towards obtaining an Associate Degree in Computer Science.

This repository is a summary of all the assignments I completed throughout the CS-250 course provided by SNHU.

I will answer some questions to provide you a better understanding:

Que 1} How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Ans-> I interpret user needs by asking key questions that will provide me the specific answers I need to understand their aspirations for their program. Furthermore, by clearly understanding and organizing the user's needs I can efficiently implement them into a program. User stories helps with understanding and implementing user needs by providing a clear layout to ask for and organize vital information that help understand and implement user needs into a program.

Que 2} How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Ans-> I approach developing programs in the following order:
        i. Understand the requirements (like, expected outputs) of the program.
        ii. Create pseudocode representing the program.
        iii. Convert pseudocode to the specific programming langage.
        iv. Test and refine.
      Regarding my future development work, I hope to incorporate Scrum to deliver functional programs that meet users' expectations in a timely manner. 
      
Que 3} What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Ans-> It means:
        1. To attend team gatherings and meetings on time.
        2. To be considerate of team members' values and feelings.
        3. To be attentive when team members are explaining their perspectives.
